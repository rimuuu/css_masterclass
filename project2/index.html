          <p> I love traveling around world. <br>
            That is one of big reason that I've got into programming 
            because I was looking for a job that I can work independently 
            and keep traveling and working both in my life.  <br>
            Also I'm interested in human's mental health and psychology. <br>
            One of my goal as a web-developer is making a service about counselling to be able to make 
            the more people take care their own mental health and happiness.

            I enjoy figuring out hard problems about social issues with other people. 
        What I believe is that code has power that makes world better. 
        I'd like to be a part of this influence as a web-developer.
        That is one of reasons I've been learning web developing and keep interest about coding.

            <span class="category"> Imperfectionist </span>
            I always persuit imperfection in my life. Because I don't want to be obessed with perfection in everything I'm doing.
            Instead of this, I prefer just doing some small things now even it looks not a big thing at the moment.
            I believe that small accomplishments will make me so much different in future. </p>
